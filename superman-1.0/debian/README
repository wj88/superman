SUPERMAN - Security Using Pre-Existing Routing fopr Mobile Ad hoc Networks

The increasing autonomy of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) has enabled a great
many large-scale unguided missions, such as agricultural planning, conservation
and similar surveying tasks. Commercial and military institutions have expressed
great interest in such ventures; raising the question of security as the
application of such systems in potentially hostile environments becomes a
desired function of such networks. Preventing theft, disruption or destruction
of such MANETs through cyber-attacks has become a focus for many researchers
as a result. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have been shown to enhance the
security of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), at a high cost in network resources
during the setup of secure tunnels. VPNs do not normally support broadcast
communication, reducing their effectiveness in high-traffic MANETs, which have
many broadcast communication requirements. To support routing, broadcast updates
and efficient MANET communication, a Virtual Closed Network (VCN) architecture
is proposed. By supporting private, secure communication in unicast, multicast
and broadcast modes, VCNs provide an efficient alternative to VPNs when securing
MANETs. Comparative analysis of the set-up overheads of VCN and VPN approaches
is provided between OpenVPN, IPsec, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and the
proposed VCN solution:
